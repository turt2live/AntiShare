# Here you can link inventories for worlds
# 
# For example, let's say you want the Survival inventory of 'world' to be 
# linked to the Survival inventory of 'world2' and 'world3'. All you would 
# have to do is use this:
# world:
#   gamemode: survival
#   linked: world2, world3
# 
# With the above setup, changes in any of the 3 worlds while in survival
# mode will be reflected upon all 3 inventories.
