# This is a list of all the names for items if you prefer to use
# names rather than item ID's, which is understandable.
# To add an alias to the list, simply set it as "alias: itemID"
# for example: 
# stone: 1
# The above sample would mean that anywhere where you have to enter
# an item ID (such as in the config.yml), anytime it sees "stone" it
# would know you mean item ID 1. 
# 
# Note: there are no defaults here as that would cause issues.
