# This file allows you to specify signs you want to block/whitelist
# 
# To add a sign from below to a block list, simply put this:
# 'sign:signname'
# 
# An example sign is below.
# 
# signname:
#   enabled: false
#   case-sensitive: false
#   line1: 'Some text'
#   line2: 'Some other text'
#   line3: 'Some more text'
#   line4: '*'
# 
# Simply copy that, uncomment it, and edit it to your needs.
# '*' means "anything", this cannot be used mid-line. If you
# want a line to be recorded as 'blank' put '*blank'.
